In this repository I am going to publish the code that I have used to get the figures for my master thesis. 

# Abstract

Political microtargeting (PMT) has become a key instrument in modern election campaigns, enabling political actors to use personal data for individually tailored messages. While this practice can enhance outreach, it also raises serious concerns about privacy, transparency, and the integrity of democratic processes. Therefore, his thesis asks if current EU regulations on political microtargeting are sufficient to prevent unlawful political influence and safeguard democratic integrity.
The study first examines the role of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as the EUâ€™s most comprehensive framework for data protection, identifying both its strengths and gaps. Additional regulatory instruments are analysed to assess whether they close these gaps or leave room for exploitation. The risks posed by predictive analytics, profiling, and behavioural targeting are then linked to wider democratic concerns such as manipulation, echo chambers, and information asymmetry.
A case study of Die Linke in the 2025 German federal election, based on Meta Ad Library data, demonstrates how even smaller parties can leverage PMT strategically to influence electoral outcomes. Finally, recent CJEU rulings and pending litigation are discussed as corrective mechanisms, though they remain reactive and fragmented.
The thesis concludes that existing regulation is insufficient, and that democracy requires a purpose-driven framework addressing not only data collection but also its political uses.
